we will use this to notify each other when one of us is going to make an edit. we'll have it so that its set up like this:
{name} i will be editing {file name, what type of edit, how many lines you think you will need to change} and then afterwards you'll list what you changed if you don't want to check the commits folder



addition: to get to the codespace, go back to the main depository and press the down arrow on the big green code button, then go to codespaces, and then go to cuddly-space-engine(it auto-generated this name) in order to find the versio we currently have
